## [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=0s)

In this course, we are going to learn how to build the **general-purpose digital device** that we call *computer* these days from the **bottom up** (hardware to software), hence our punny tagline: *full-stack developer*. We will start with understanding how we can encode information in terms of **voltages**, and then how to utilize transistors to synthesize logic. We can use them to create a bigger -- more complex programmable system, and eventually with a properly designed instruction set, we can understand how a general purpose programmable machine is made. 

In this chapter, we will begin our journey by learning how we can **represent** and **encode** *information*, and then followed by how we can store this information in a tangible form using **voltages** (*next chapter)*.

{: .highlight}
**Information** is defined as *knowledge* communicated or received concerning a particular fact or circumstance. It resolves **uncertainty**. 

We can quantify information in electronic devices in terms of *bits* (binary digits, consisted of simply `1`s and `0`s). Strings of bits can represent *integer* values. Therefore we can use them in a way so that our devices can perform (mathematical) ***computation*** using this form of quantified information. 


## [Binary Number System ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=388s)

Our computers are electronic devices that can only store informations in terms of electrical signals: high signal and low signal. Therefore we need to work using the binary (base 2) number system and not the decimal number system that we are more familiar with. 

How do we represent integers (basic numbers) in binary? Suppose we have binary number:

```cpp
0 0 1 1 0 1 
```

The above means the integer value:
$$0 \times 2^5 + 0 \times 2^4 + 1\times 2^3$$  $$+ 1\times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 13$$ in decimal (base 10). 

{: .note}
Binary to Decimal conversion is really **simple**, but takes time to get used to. 

## [Hex and Octal Number System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=615s)
What if encoding in binary is too long on paper or text editor? We can use other number systems: encode in **octal** (base 8) or **hex** (base 16) to shorten its representation, so that it's more "human friendly" to write.

See the table below to find out the direct conversion between binary, octal, hex, and decimal. 

{: .note-title}
> Don't Worry!
> 
> After some practice, it should be easy to naturally guess the decimal value of any 4-bit number without computing them from scratch. 

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/week1notes/table.png"  class="center_thirty" />

{: .note-title}
> Prefix and Suffix
> 
> We typically use the **prefix** `0x`  to indicate that a number system is encoded in **hexadecimal** and not decimal.  If we encode a number in binary, we can use the **prefix** `0b` or not at all (because it is pretty obvious since a string of numbers only contain `0`s and `1`s). Numbers encoded in oct will have the **suffix** $$_8$$.


The examples below should provide a straightforward hints on [how to convert between the number systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=780s). 

### Example 1

 1. Binary : 101 101 101 111
 2.  Octal : $$5557_8$$:
	 * To obtain this, group the binary digits into groups of 3 bits **from right to left** and convert them to its corresponding octal representation.
	 * `101 101 101 111` : `5557`$$_8$$
 3.  Decimal : 2927 
 4.  Hex: `0xB6F` 
	 * To obtain this, group the binary into groups of 4 bits **from right to left** as well, and convert each group to its corresponding hex representation.
	 * `1011 0110 1111` : `0xB6F` 

### Example 2

1. Binary : 111 110 101
2. Octal : $$765_8$$ 
3. Decimal : 501
4.  Hex:
* **Pad** the higher bits of the binary so that the *total number of bits* is the closest **divisible** by 4. In this case, we expand from 9 bits to 12 bits by adding three `0`s at the higher bits. **Notice that this does not change the numerical value of the binary string.** 
*  `111 110 101` is equivalent to `0001 1111 0101,` hence `0x1F5`




## [2's Complement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=1113s)

2's Complement is the way most computers or electronic machines choose to represent *signed* integers. Given a string of bits, we can compute its negative representation using 2's Complement. 

Firstly, most computers chooses to use the **most significant bit (MSB)** as the indicator of whether a particular integer is positive or negative. 

{: .important}
> Signed or unsigned?
> 
> You can't tell whether a device supports signed or unsigned bits by looking at its output bits alone.  To determine whether a machine is signed or unsigned, you need to check specific documentation or system properties related to the machine or software.

For example: 
* `00101` is a positive number: $$2^2 + 2^0 = 5$$
* `11011` is a negative number: $$-2^4 + 2^3 +2^1+ 2^0 = -16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = -5$$

To compute the 2's Complement representation of $$5$$ and represent a negative version of it in a computer, we need to apply the following mathematical operation to the original bits:

 - **Step 1**: inverse all 0s into 1s and vice versa on the *original* binary number
- **Step 2:** add 1 **to the number in step 1**

### Example

`0 0 1 1 = 3` $$\rightarrow$$ we want to turn this into -3, so we do the steps below: 
- **Step 1**: 1 1 0 0 (inversed)
- **Step 2**: 1 1 0 0 + 0 0 0 1 = 1 1 0 1 (add 1)

The value of the result of step 2 above is : $$-2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 = -3$$.

The 2's Complement is an operation that can be applied to either numbers: the positive or the negative, and it will yield its counterpart. 

### [Decimal Encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=1380s)

{: .warning-title}
> Out of Syllabus
> 
> This section is not tested, and is simply written for completeness of knowledge only. 

How to encode decimal in binary? We extend our prior knowledge. Suppose we have **signed** binary number:

```cpp
1 0 0 1 . 0 0 1 1
```

The above means $$-1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^{-3} + 1 \times 2^{-4}$$.

## [Encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=1398s)
 
Encoding is the process of assigning *representations* to information. Strings of bits can mean some value of integers, but we can also assign a fixed repesentation to them. For example, given four choices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, we can assign two bits each to encode each choice: `00`, `01`, `10`, `11` if they are *equally probable.* 

More precisely, it is called the **fixed length encoding**, that is used in practice when all choices $$x_i, i=1,...N$$ are ***equally* probable**.  

{:.note}
There also exist **variable length encoding** but we will not learn that in this course. 
 
Example of encoding is character encoding so that the string of bits can be displayed to us properly: 
* **Number Encoding** : 4-bits to represent each number 1 to 10 
* **7-bit** ASCII encoding for english characters (no need to memorize, it's just here for fun information only). However it's usually represented as 1 byte (8 bits). Other common character encodings:
  * An **ISO-8895-1** character in **ISO-8859-1** encoding is 8 bits (1 byte). 
  * A **Unicode** character in **UTF-8** encoding is between 8 bits (1 byte) and 32 bits (4 bytes)
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/0xizcif6yux3uyi/ascii.jpg?raw=1"  class="center_seventy"  >
* **16-bit** Unicode (UTF-16) encoding: for other language alphabets that are fixed, e.g: Russian, Korean

We can create electronic devices that are able to *map* (decode) given encoded information, perform computations based on the received information, and encode back the output so that the results can be interpreted by us (users) or other devices. 
## The `Byte` Convention

{: .warning-title}
> Convention: 1 Byte is 8 Bit
>
> The byte is a **unit** of digital information that consists of **8 bits**. 
 
Our system usually report storage amount (disk space, RAM, etc) in terms of **bytes** instead of bits. Historically, the byte (groups of 8 bits) is smallest **addressable** unit of memory in many computer architectures and therefore storage systems are typically reported in terms of **bytes**. A RAM of 1GB in size means that it can hold $$1 \times 8$$ billion bits of data.

The prefix "Giga" means $$10^9$$ in International Unit of Systems (SI), however when you plug in a 1GB RAM, your system might report it as 0.93GB instead. This is because in computing, *Giga* means $$1024^3 = 2^{30}$$ bytes exactly instead of $$10^9$$ bytes because we operate in **base** 2 instead of base 10 in SI. To avoid this confusion, there exist another set of prefixes: Kib, Mib, and Gib to denote $$1024$$ bytes, $$1024^2$$ bytes, and $$1024^3$$ bytes in digital systems. 

## Introduction to Logic Gates

{:.new-title}
> Logic Gates 
> 
> Logic gates are **basic** electronic devices that perform Boolean logic operations, taking binary inputs (0s and 1s) and producing a <span class="orange-bold">single</span> binary output.  They form <span class="orange-bold">building blocks</span> of digital circuits They are implemented using **physical** components such as **transistors** and **diodes** to process digital information in computing hardware. We'll focus on the theory of logic gates first, while the details of transistors and hardware implementation will be covered later.


In the previous section, we learn how information is represented using **binary** form, characterized by sequences of 0s and 1s. These binary digits do <span class="orange-bold">more</span> than just represent numerical values; they are fundamental to the operational logic of computers. 

Each binary digit forms the basis for decision-making processes within digital circuits, where these 0s and 1s are interpreted not just as numbers but as <span class="orange-bold">discrete</span> states—off or on, `false` or `true`. This binary decision-making is implemented through the use of <span class="orange-bold">logic gates</span>, which manipulate these bits to perform all kinds of computational tasks, from basic arithmetic to complex algorithmic executions. 

{:.note}
Understanding binary digits paves the way for understanding how computers **process** information, **make** decisions, and ultimately **execute** tasks.

### Basic Boolean Logic Operations

Boolean operations form the core of digital logic, using simple rules to determine outputs from binary inputs. These operations are critical for understanding how logic gates manipulate data to perform computations. Below are the basic Boolean operations that are pivotal in digital electronics:

1. **AND**: Returns true if all the inputs are true.
2. **OR**: Returns true if at least one of the inputs is true.
3. **NOT**: Returns the opposite of the input value.
4. **BUFFER**: Passes the input directly to the output without any modification.
5. **XOR** (Exclusive OR): Returns true if an odd number of inputs are true.

Each of these operations corresponds to a specific type of logic gate that we will explore next, demonstrating how theoretical Boolean logic is applied practically in hardware design.

### Basic Types of Logic Gates

Every logic gate has one output terminal (Z). The number of input terminal can vary from `1` to `N`. 

#### AND Gate
**Function**: Produces an output of `1` only if all its inputs are `1`.
**Input Terminals**: 2 or more. 

**Truth Table**:

A | B|  Z
---------|----------|---------
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

**Digital Hardware Symbol**:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025.drawio.png"  class="center_twenty"/>

**Practical application in programming**:  in a while loop, an `AND` gate can be used to ensure that the loop continues to iterate only as long as all specified conditions remain true,

```cpp
while (conditionA && conditionB) {
    // execute code
}
```

#### OR Gate
**Function**: Produces an output of `1` only if at least one of its inputs is `1`.
**Input Terminals**: 2 or more. 

**Truth Table**:

A | B|  Z
---------|----------|---------
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 1

**Digital Hardware Symbol**:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025-OR.drawio.png"  class="center_twenty"/>

**Practical application in programming**:   used to ensure that a certain block of code executes if any of the specified conditions are true,

```cpp
if (condition1 || condition2) {
    // execute code
}
```

#### XOR Gate
**Function**: Produces an output of `1` when an odd number of inputs are `1`.
**Input Terminals**: 2 or more. 

**Truth Table**:

A | B|  Z
---------|----------|---------
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0

**Digital Hardware Symbol**:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025-XOR.drawio.png"  class="center_twenty"/>

**Practical application in programming**:  useful when you need to check for conditions that must be mutually exclusive, like scenarios such as setting toggles where one option disables the other,

```cpp
if (condition1 ^ condition2) {
    // execute code if exactly one condition is true
}
```

#### NOT Gate (Inverter)
**Function**: Produces an output that is the inverse of the input.
**Input Terminals**: exactly 1.

**Truth Table**:

A |  Z
---------|----------
0 | 1
1 | 0 

**Digital Hardware Symbol**:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025-NOT.drawio.png"  class="center_twenty"/>

**Practical application in programming**:  an if statement where you want to execute code only if a condition is not met,

```cpp
if (!condition) {
    // execute code if the condition is false
}
```

#### BUFFER Gate
**Function**: Outputs exactly what it receives as input; it acts as a repeater.
**Input Terminals**: exactly 1.

**Truth Table**:

A |  Z
---------|----------
0 | 0
1 | 1 

**Digital Hardware Symbol**:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025-BUFFER.drawio.png"  class="center_twenty"/>

**Practical application**: Not obvious in programming, but A buffer gate in digital hardware level serves as a signal **strengthener**, essentially passing the input it receives directly to its output without alteration, but often with increased drive capability. This means it helps in <span class="orange-bold">maintaining the integrity</span> of the signal through physically long circuits or across components that might degrade the signal due to resistance or other factors.

### Combining Logic Gates 

Understanding how these gates work individually is just the beginning. The next step is to see how they **combine** to perform **complex** operations and make decisions within digital circuits (and ultimately how to make a **general purpose computers** from billions of these gates). This knowledge is not only pivotal for building hardware but also enhances our ability to design efficient, **programmable** systems. 

For example, let's build a two-bit **comparator** that determines if one binary number $$A$$ is **greater** than another $$B$$ (only checking for greater than, *not* less than). Each binary number consists of two bits: $$A_1A_0$$, and $$B_1B_0$$. The comparator will produce a one bit output indicating whether $$A\geB$$. If you were to write a **program** for this, you would write something like this: 

```py
def is_a_greater_than_b(A1, A0, B1, B0):
    # Check the most significant bits first
    if A1 and not B1:
        return True
    elif A1 == B1:
        # If most significant bits are equal, check the least significant bits
        if A0 and not B0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False

# Example usage:
# Let's assume A = 10 (binary) and B = 01 (binary)
# A1 = 1, A0 = 0, B1 = 0, B0 = 1
result = is_a_greater_than_b(1, 0, 0, 1)
print("Is A > B?", result)
```

The logic of the function implemented in Python above can be translated into a **hardware design** using <span class="orange-bold">logic gates</span>, which form the basis of a hardware comparator unit. In hardware, the function's operations—comparing bits and determining the result based on their values—would be implemented using a combination of basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR gates. Here's a hardware design that implements `is_a_greater_than_b` function above: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025-A-greaterthan-B.drawio.png"  class="center_seventy"/>


**Breakdown**

1. **Comparing Most Significant Bits (MSBs)**:
   - **AND Gate**: Used to check if \( A1 \) is 1 and \( B1 \) is 0 directly, mapping to `A1 and not B1`.
   - This result can directly influence the output if \( A \) is greater, bypassing the need to check the least significant bits (LSBs).

2. **Equality Check**:
   - **XNOR Gate**: Typically, you might use an XNOR gate to compare \( A1 \) and \( B1 \) to check for equality because XNOR outputs true when both inputs are equal. This can control whether to proceed to compare the LSBs.

3. **Comparing Least Significant Bits (LSBs)**:
   - **AND Gate**: Similar to the MSB comparison, another AND gate can be used for `A0 and not B0` to check the condition when the MSBs are equal.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - **OR Gate**: If \( A1 > B1 \) or (if equal and \( A0 > B0 \)), then \( A > B \). This can be implemented by feeding the outputs of the respective AND gates to an OR gate, whose output would then represent \( A > B \).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The outputs of these gates would typically be connected to form the logic needed for the comparator. For \( A = B \), the output from an XNOR gate (checking both bits pairs) could be used directly, and for \( A < B \), you could mirror the \( A > B \) logic by swapping inputs.

### Example of Practical Application
In practical applications, such hardware comparators are used in sorting algorithms implemented in hardware, digital signal processing for real-time decision making, and anywhere within a digital system where two binary values need to be **compared** quickly and efficiently without the overhead of software computation.

For instance: **automatic focus adjustment in digital cameras**
- Multiple hardware comparators can be used to compare the sharpness levels (converted into binary values) of different focus settings in real-time. 
- Each comparator evaluates pairs of sharpness values to determine which focus setting produces a clearer, sharper image.
- The use of hardware comparators allows this decision process to be almost <span class="orange-bold">instantaneous</span>, which is essential for photography where lighting and scene conditions can change rapidly.

## Abstraction: A General Purpose Computer 

Logic gates form the <span class="orange-bold">bedrock</span> upon which general-purpose computers are built, translating fundamental digital principles into versatile computing capabilities. By implementing basic operations like AND, OR, and NOT at the hardware level, these gates enable computers to perform complex calculations and decision-making processes efficiently. 

{:.important}
This foundational hardware logic allows developers to abstract away from the physical electronics to focus on software development. 

In practical terms, this means that *instead* of manually constructing circuits in a lab for specific tasks, programmers can write flexible and sophisticated Python code that the computer interprets and executes using its underlying logic gate-driven architecture. Thus, the intricate arrangement of logic gates in a computer's hardware directly empowers the high-level programming and software applications that drive modern technology, seamlessly bridging the gap between electronic design and software functionality.


## [Information and uncertainty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=1761s)

After exploring the fundamental operations performed by logic gates, it's crucial to **understand** how these elements contribute to the <span class="orange-bold">broader</span> context of <span class="orange-bold">information processing</span> in computing systems. 

{:.highlight}
Information theory, which quantifies the amount of information in messages or events based on their probability, provides a mathematical foundation for many aspects of computer science, including data compression, error detection, and cryptography.

The amount of information held by an **event** is **inversely proportional to** the probability $$p$$ of that event happening,

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Information } \propto \text{ Uncertainty} \propto \text{ }\frac{1}{p}.\end{aligned}$$

Equivalently, the amount of information given is **proportional to** the *uncertainty* of that event happening. More precisely, to the logarithm of the *uncertainty* of the event happening. However since $$\log$$ is an increasing function,  the  sense of *proportionality* remains the same. 


{: .new-title}
> In Layman Terms
> 
> If an event is bound to happen, then the fact that the event happens does not give any kind of information.


For discrete events $$(x_1, x_2, ... , x_N)$$ with probability of occurence of $$(p_1, p_2, ..., p_N)$$, the basic measure of information for all of these events is the ***bit***. 

The number of bits is needed to reveal that a random variable is $$x_i$$ is:

$$\begin{aligned}
I(X) =  \log_2 \frac{1}{p_i} \text{ bits},\end{aligned}$$

where  $$I(X)$$ is the amount of information received in bits learning that the choice was $$x_i$$.   

### [Equal Probability Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=1900s)   
Let $$N = 8$$, and all 8 events are *equally probable.* The number of bits needed to encode all 8 events are: 

$$\begin{aligned} I(X) &= \log_2 \frac{1}{1/8} = 3 \text{ bits}. \end{aligned}$$ 
 
We need to receive 3 bits of information to learn that one event $$x_i$$ out of the 8 events happens. In this case, it can be `000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110,` and `111`. 

### [Narrowing Down Choices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=1930s)
With $$N$$ *equally probable choices,* if it is narrowed down to $$M$$ choices (where $$N>M$$), then we can say that we are given

$$\begin{aligned}
I_{N\rightarrow M}(X) = \log_2 \left( \frac{N}{M} \right) \text{ bits}\end{aligned}$$
 

Continuing from the example above, if our pool of possible events are narrowed down to 3 from 8, then intuitively we only need *2 bits* (instead of 3) to encode 3 different events, e.g: `00, 01,` and `10`. Therefore  we know we are given *at least* `1` bit of information.

With the formula above, `N=8`, `M=3`, therefore: 

$$\begin{aligned}
I_{8\rightarrow 3}(X) = \log_2 \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) = 1.42 \text{ bits}
\end{aligned}$$

{:.important}
It is important to consider how the certainty or predictability of an event (or data set) **influences** how we can encode, transmit, and store it. The concepts of entropy and the logarithmic measure of information provide the theoretical underpinnings for many practical applications in computer science. Head to [appendix](#practical-relevance-of-information-theory) for relevant practical examples if you're interested. 



## [Summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicB30kA3pY&list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_&index=1&t=2094s)

Here are the key points from this notes:

1. **Number Systems**: Digital systems uses **binary** number system, but we touched on decimal, octal, and hexadecimal number systems for convenient representation.
2. **2's Complement**: Signed integers are represented using 2's complement (flip the bits then increment by 1), thus enabling the representation of negative numbers in binary form. 
3. **Basic Logic Gates**: Get familiar with **basic** logic operations like XOR, AND, OR, and INV. These basic logic gates are the basic building blocks for a more complex combinational circuit. 
4. **Encoding Methods**: There exist **fixed** encoding and variable encoding methods, but we only touched on the former. Fixed encoding refers to a method of representing information, such as text, data, or signals, where a predefined, unchanging scheme is used to encode and decode the information (like ASCII and Unicode). This is useful so that we can consistently represent data across different systems. 
5. **Information Theory**: Information can be quantified based on the probability of events. The amount of information held by an **event** is **inversely proportional to** the probability $$p$$ of that event happening. Information can be represented in terms of **bits** by taking $\log_2$ of its inverse probability. 

Given $$X$$ bits of data:

1.  We can **encode** $$2^X$$ *choices, or random variables*
	> Equivalently, given $$Y$$ choices, we need to use at least $$\log_2(Y)$$ bits to encode them, rounded up to the nearest integer (since we cannot technically subdivide "bits" in real life. 

2.  If it is **unsigned**, we can represent the number ranged from 0 to $$2^X-1$$

3.  If it is **signed**, we can represent the number ranged from
    $$-2^{X-1}$$ to $$2^{X-1}-1$$

## Next Steps

{: .highlight }
Finally, you might be wondering why are we *counting the number of bits* required to encode some amount of information, and why do we bother with encoding information in terms of bits at all. 

As said in the introduction, the **goal** of this course is to learn how to build a general-purpose digital device (computers).

We begin the first half of our learning journey by trying to **create** a digital device (not for general purpose yet) that's for a **specific purpose,** for example: 
* a *simple* device that can perform N-bit addition  *(Lab 1: Combinational Logic With FPGA)*, 
* a *simple* device that can perform basic logic computation: addition, subtraction, bitshift, boolean operation *(Lab 3 & 4: ALU)*,
* a *simple* electronic game device that can take input from players, compute it, and determine the winner *(1D Project)*


### Information as Voltage Values
Regardless of the *specific* purpose, we need a way to implement the **logic** ("*addition*" logic for example) for this machine. If we were to explain the workings of an **adder** to you, it will be pretty easy because we use the English language to *communicate* all the necessary information for you to understand how it works. Explaining this **logic** to a machine isn't quite as easy because *they don't understand English* -- they only can comprehend "low" and "high" voltages. 

**Therefore we have to *move* the domain of which we convey information in terms of binary digits (bits),** and get used to encoding **logic** (information) in this domain.    

Once we are **comfortable**  with conveying logic (information) in terms of bits, then we have to start finding **components** that can manipulate voltages, and this component is called a **transistor** -- which you will learn pretty soon. 

{: .note-title}
> Problem Sets
> 
> The problem sets are created so that you're comfortable with bit manipulation and *communicating* (with your future machine) in that domain.  

{: .note}
Transistor is *not the first* tool created to manipulate voltages: triode vacuum tubes and electro-mechanical relays were used in pre-1950s. Before electricity was discovered, people used **mechanical** gears and **punch cards** to encode  digital data. Also in case it's not clear, digital data is the *discrete*, discontinuous *representation* of **information**.

### Early Transistors
If you Google "triode vacuum tubes", and "electro-mechanical relays" -- or even the "**early transistors**", you'd realise that they have quite a **large** size and they are definitely **not cheap.** You can find some information [here](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-much-did-early-transistors-cost) for context, but on average in the past it costs about $$8$$ each. They cost about **a billion times** more than they are now, *so your computers that have billions of transistors might cost you a few billion $$ in the past (not to mention that it would've been enormous in size too).* 

It might be **unimaginable** how big and expensive computers were at first because we are so used to having portable computers -- consisting of billions of **cheap** and *extremely small* transistors (5-7nm) and pretty much "*unlimited*" storage unit (we can always buy external drive, cloud storage, extend our RAM or simply buy computers with terabytes of disk size). But in the past -- life wasn't quite as easy.

With this in mind, it makes sense that if someone (in the past) were to make a digital device **from scratch**, he or she has to be *mindful* with the **size and cost of the device**, and therefore has to be mindful with *counting (and probably minimising)* how many **bits** are needed to contain all information and *logic* necessary for the intended device to work.


### General Purpose Computers
But having a digital device that can do **only that** **specific** job: just *addition*, just that *game* logic, or just playing a VCD (VCD player) is **not enough**. We do not want to:
* Have so many devices to carry 
* Spend so much money to buy 1 device for each task
* It will be ridiculous now to imagine if we need 1 separate, physical device for everything: 1 device to browse, 1 device for *each* video game, 1 device for chatting with a *particular* person, 1 device for computing addition, 1 device for computing division... *you get the idea.* 

Therefore towards the middle of the term, we will learn how to create a **better** digital device: a **programmable** one that is suitable to be used for a plethora of purposes **without any hardware changes** -- *and can manipulate, store, and produce digital data.*   

We will consider all things necessary to create this programmable device that can tend to various **general** purposes *(not just limited purposes)*  -- meaning to create a device that can **emulate** the behavior of many other devices (given a **description** of how that other devices work: *software*), so that we simply just need to get this **ONE** device to perform many tasks and computations. **This device is none other than our computers.**

## Practical Relevance of Information Theory 
Expanding the practical relevance of information theory, let's further explore how the foundational principles link to the applications of logic gates and their broader impacts on technology and digital systems.

#### Error Detection and Correction:
The principles of information theory are crucial in the design of error-correcting codes. These codes are fundamental for communication systems, where they ensure that data is transmitted accurately over noisy channels. Logic gates are integral in constructing these codes; for instance, XOR gates are often used in parity checks, which are a basic form of error detection. Engineers design circuits that automatically correct errors in data transmission, enhancing reliability in everything from satellite communications to internet traffic.

#### Data Compression:
Information theory provides the mathematical underpinnings for data compression techniques, which are essential for managing large datasets, streaming video, and optimizing storage. Compression algorithms, like Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv, rely on the probabilities of data occurrences to reduce the number of bits required to represent the data. Logic gates in hardware accelerators perform these algorithms rapidly, supporting real-time data compression which is crucial for streaming services and telecommunication.

#### Optimizing Data Storage and Retrieval:
In the context of databases and memory systems, the 'information content' or entropy of data determines the most efficient ways to store and retrieve it. For example, databases use indexing mechanisms, which are optimized based on the expected frequency of query terms, directly applying principles from information theory. Logic gates are used to design the circuits in SSDs and RAM that manage data access and storage, ensuring quick retrieval and efficient space usage.

#### Digital Signal Processing (DSP):
Digital signal processors use various algorithms to manipulate signals such as audio, video, and other data inputs in real time. Information theory guides DSP algorithms to filter out noise and enhance signal integrity. Logic gates are employed in DSP chips to execute these algorithms efficiently, enabling applications like noise-canceling headphones and high-definition television.

#### Network Routing and Management:
Information theory also informs network routing algorithms that manage the flow of data across computer networks. Routing protocols use probabilities and information metrics to make decisions about the best paths for data packets to travel, optimizing network performance and reliability. The hardware that drives these decisions uses complex arrays of logic gates to process routing information dynamically.

#### Cryptography:
Cryptography relies heavily on information theory to secure data. Understanding the entropy of systems and their data helps in designing secure encryption protocols, where logic gates play a role in the actual encryption and decryption processes. For instance, XOR gates are a basic component in many encryption algorithms, including stream ciphers.

### Conclusion
By linking the theoretical aspects of information theory with practical applications through logic gates, we see a direct impact on numerous technologies. These applications not only demonstrate the practical utility of theoretical knowledge but also underscore the importance of digital logic design in modern computing and electronic communication. This expansion into the practical relevance of information theory and logic gates reveals their profound interconnectedness and the pivotal role they play in the technological advancements that define our digital age.
